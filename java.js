// Car factory
// Create a constructor function that can be used to create objects.

// The objects your factory creates should all have a "type" propety that always has the value "car".

// The factory should take in three parameters and save them to the created objects:

// make
// model
// year
// Use your function to create 10 different cars. Store all of them inside a "garage" array.

// ðŸ¤–: Nothing to see down here

function car(make, model, year) {
    this.type ="car"
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
  }
